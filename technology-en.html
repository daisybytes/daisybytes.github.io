Therefore it can be deployed to virtually every modern platform with native Java support. With an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming, it can make use of modern multi-core CPUs and any existing Java framework. Thanks to its simplicity by design and its excellent builtin specification and testing features, it furthermore allows to rapidly deploy a prototype and to incrementially tune that initial version according to immediate client and user feedback. With these characteristics, it is a natural fit for agile development approaches which DAISYBYTES intends to primarily rely on. By making extensive use of Clojure as first core-technology, DAISYBYTES strives to find a clean, correct, powerful yet simple solution for your demands. </div> </div> </div> <div class="tech_section"> <div class="outter-valign-center"> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <a href="https://clojurescript.org/" target="_blank"><img class="external_product_logo" src="/resources/cljs_logo.png"></a> </div> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <h2 class="tech_header" id="cljs"><a href="https://clojurescript.org/" target="_blank">ClojureScript</a></h2> ClojureScript is a compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It combines the reach of the JavaScript platform, the flexibility and interactive development of Clojure, and the whole-program optimization of Google Closure to provide the most powerful language for programming the web. It also includes implementations for popular libraries like React or Om and has strongly been driven forward by Google, which successfully applies it within its online suite. DAISYBYTES chose the make ClojureScript the second core-technology because it provides synergy effects inside the overall Clojure ecosystem that can reduce development time and increase the quality of the overall result. </div> </div> </div> <div class="tech_section"> <div class="outter-valign-center"> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <a href="https://www.datomic.com/" target="_blank"><img class="external_product_logo" src="/resources/datomic_logo.png"></a> </div> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <h2 class="tech_header" id="datomic"><a href="https://www.datomic.com/" target="_blank">Datomic</a></h2> Datomic (an implementation of Datalog) is a transactional, distributed, commercially-supported database developed by <a href="https://www.cognitect.com" target="_blank">Cognitect</a>. Itself written in Clojure, it features a very flexible data model, elastic scaling and rich, expressive queries that are easy to reason about. It was designed from the ground up to run on AWS but can also be deployed on premise if desired. It includes encryption at rest, VPC isolation, monitoring and logging capabilities as well as deployment via CloudFormation and a fully-integrated management from within the AWS Console. Datomic provides the power of schema without requiring all definitions up-front. Because Datomic stores all data by default, it is possible to audit how and when any change was made. Especially for financial, medical or general inventory records, which get tracked over time, Datomic is the perfect fit. Datomic also significantly reduces complexity and thereby shortens development time and allows an easy evolution of the overall system in development. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="tech_section" id="open-source"> <div class="outter-valign-center"> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank"><img class="external_product_logo" src="/resources/foss_logo.png"></a> </div> <div class="inner-valign-center"> <h2 class="tech_header" id="foss"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">Free Open-Source Software</a> </h2> DAISYBYTES focuses primarily on the usage of free (as in freedom) open-source software (FOSS) to grant you the following advantages within your project: <br><br> <ul> <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> <b>Superior Security</b><br> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law" target="_blank">"Linus' Law"</a> by Linux creator Linus Torvalds "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." In other words, defects inside the code can be fixed faster if a larger number of developers can audit and test it. Being able to audit the entire codebase also allows complete confidence about knowing what and how any of your data will be used instead of just believing in whatever the vendor of any propriatary software is claiming. </li> <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> <b>Superior Quality</b><br> Countless passionate developers and users strive to improve open-source software and contribute innovations day by day. Open-source projects will be closest to what their users really wish for because that users can have active part in shaping it. </li> <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> <b>More Freedom</b><br> Users of open-source software have complete control over which version to use, if and when to upgrade and can customize everything exactly to their demands. Large, vibrant communities of developers and users around the globe are at hand for either free-of-charge or even commercial support ranging from technical documentation to live chats. Open-source complies to open standards which makes it easier to integrate it into a larger system of multiple, different components. </li> <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> <b>No vendor-lockin</b><br> Due to the nature of the development model, with its focus on open standards, open source software vendor lock-in is much more unlikely when compared to the usage of proprietary software. </li> <li> <b>Less Costs</b><br> License fees, support charges, update or upgrade expenses as well as indirect costs as result of a vendor-lock do not exist with open-source software. Evaluations can be done completely with absolutely no commitment and of course free-of-charge until you are really sure which way to go. </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </main> <footer> <div class="footer-top"> <div class="footer-left"> <div class="minor-links"> <a href="/legal-notice-en.html">Legal Notice</a> <span class="footer-item-separator">|</span> <a href="/privacy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a> </div> </div> <div class="footer-right"> <b>©&nbsp;2021 G.K.
